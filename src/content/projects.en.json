      "description": "As Christmas approaches, Karen decorates her tree in Argentina when an unexpected message arrives from a woman in Norway. The woman reveals a surprising connection: her grandmother was once romantically involved with Karen's grandfather, nearly a century ago. Intrigued, Karen sifts through old family photographs, hoping to uncover traces of this long-lost relationship. But the deeper she delves, the more questions arise. Determined to uncover the truth, Karen embarks on a journey to Norway to reunite with her family and trace her grandfather's past. Her trip unfolds into a rich exploration of childhood memories, her \"Bestefar's\" immigration story, lost love, and the scars of war—leading her closer to the answers she's been searching for.",
